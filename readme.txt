= Translations =

Breadcrumb NavXT bbPress Extensions is distributed with translations for the following languages:

== Installation ==
Install via the built in WordPress plugin installer. Then activate the plugin, that's it!

To customize the breadcrumb trail you may edit the default values for the options in the administrative interface. This is located in your administration panel under Settings > Breadcrumb NavXT.
